    "    - This means passing all the tests you can see in the notebook here does not guarantee you have the right answer!\n",
    "    - In particular many of the tests you can see simply check that the right variable names exist. Hidden tests check the actual values. \n",
    "        - It is up to you to check the values, and make sure they seem reasonable.\n",
    "- A reminder to restart the kernel and re-run the code as a first line check if things seem to go weird.\n",
    "    - For example, note that some cells can only be run once, because they re-write a variable (for example, your dataframe), and change it in a way that means a second execution will fail. \n",
    "    - Also, running some cells out of order might change the dataframe in ways that may cause an error, which can be fixed by re-running."

This serves both as a way to get a 'feel' for the data, and to look for any quirks or oddities about the data, that may indicate issues that need resolving. To do this, let's explore that data a bit (not limiting ourselves to only features that we plan to use - exploring the dataset as a whole can help us find any issues). \n",

The p value of this test was low enough to be less than 0.01 which we considered significant. However, after analyzing the ratio of women in each major, and given the general idea that females are shorter than males on average, we decided to try and control for the gender imbalance between the majors. After fitting the data to an Ordinary Least Squares regression, with height as the dependent variable, and with major and gender as independent variables, it was found that there was no significant relationship between height and major because the p-value of this test was 0.399 which was not less than 0.01.
